### What is a food deserts?
While there are many ways to define a food desert, the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) Working Group considers a food desert as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. To qualify as low-income, census tracts must meet the Treasury Department's New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program eligibility criteria. Furthermore, to qualify as a food desert tract, at least 33 percent of the tract's population or a minimum of 500 people in the tract must have low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. 

### What does a food desert look like in Los Angeles?
An urban food desert is a low income area where at least one third of the population are more than one mile from a supermarket or grocery store that sells affordable good quality fresh food.

### What is LA doing to combat food deserts?
One of the stated goals of the City of Los Angeles’ Sustainability Plan is to “Ensure all low-income Angelenos live within a half mile of fresh food by 2035.”  Based on LA’s goals a food desert can be defined (local to City of Los Angeles) as  an area having low-income residents living more than a half a mile away from fresh food.
