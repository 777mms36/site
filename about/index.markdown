# About Our Team

In 2015, Feeding America reported that 1.5 million people in Los Angeles County lack sufficient funds to buy food, making it home to the US’s largest population of individuals affected by Food Insecurity. Today, there are hundreds of efforts – spanning the non-profit, community-based, governmental, educational and for-profit sectors – that are currently planning and implementing solutions to Food Insecurity in Los Angeles. 

Food Oasis Los Angeles (FOLA) is creating a web/mobile platform to visualize the complex landscape of these often disparate solutions on one map.

<br />

## Our Mission

To create an interactive digital hub that helps Angelenos navigate the abundance of healthy food resources available in the city.
