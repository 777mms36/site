# About this project

In 2015, Feeding America reported that 1.5 million people in Los Angeles County lack sufficient funds to buy food, making it home to the US’s largest population of individuals affected by Food Insecurity. Today, there are hundreds of efforts – spanning the non-profit, community-based, governmental, educational and for-profit sectors – that are currently planning and implementing solutions to Food Insecurity in Los Angeles. 

Food Oasis Los Angeles (FOLA) is creating a web/mobile platform to visualize the complex landscape of these often disparate solutions on one map.

FOLA’s platform is intended for use by:

LA community members affected by food Insecurity.
FOLA is working to unify, process and create datasets that map the range of available Food resources. Customize which datasets are shown so you can see solutions that align with your personal preferences and needs.

###POLICY-MAKERS
Policy-makers including politicians, non-profit organizations and community members. 
Find existing solutions along with “Food Deserts” and outcomes like health metrics and poverty rates. Take advantage of the visual information to
fight Food Insecurity in your communities.

###VOLUNTEERS
Concerned citizens who want to get involved. 
Many Angelinos – those affected by Food Insecurity and those not – are asking: How can I help? FOLA’s platform aims to connect concerned individuals with opportunities to volunteer, donate and get involved in Food Security activism.

## Our Mission

To build a unified hub for Angelenos to easily find healthy food.
